# Dotfiles

This repository is used to setup my Fedora Workstation. It consists of various Ansible playbooks that automate a
large chunk of setting up tools, configuartion files and system packages. 

This repository will setup the tools, packages, and services that I use on my GNOME Workstation. They are controlled by flags that can be setup in `config.yaml`.

All configuration should be done through `config.yaml`.

To understand how to configure the installation, refer to [`CONFIGURATION.md`](./CONFIGURATION.md)
